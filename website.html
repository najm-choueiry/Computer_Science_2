        <h1>Introduction to Computer Science</h1>

        <p>
          <span class="computer_science">Computer science </span>is the study of
          computation, automation, and information.Computer science spans
          theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation,
          information theory, and automation) to practical disciplines
          (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).
          Computer science is generally considered an academic discipline and
          distinct from computer programming.
        </p>

          Computer science focuses on the development and testing of software
          and software systems. It involves working with mathematical models,
          data analysis and security, algorithms, and computational theory.
          Computer scientists define the computational principles that are the
          basis of all software.

        <h1>What is the Importance of Computer Science?</h1>

        <p>
          Even when we think we’ve “unplugged” from society, there are devices
          running in the background throughout our homes and in our
          neighborhoods. It’s safe to say we live in a world that relies heavily
          on technology. In this society, two types of people have emerged:
          those who let technology run their lives and those who create
          technology that changes lives. Which side would you rather be on?
          Computer scientists solve complex problems such as predicting natural
          disasters, mapping viral outbreak patterns, improving our health care
          system and making education accessible. For example, online education
          was something people once scoffed at, and now, people can learn almost
          anything online from YouTube tutorials to free learning platforms,
          such as Khan Academy.

        <h1>What are the Benefits of Computer Science?</h1>
        <p>
          Most companies are tech companies in some capacity, whether it’s a
          brick-and-mortar retailer moving into the e-commerce space or using an
          app to get your favorite food delivered to your door, computer science
          technology has improved our access so that almost anything we want is
          at our fingertips. Salary may depend on experience and industry, but
          the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports a median pay of
          $110,140 per year or $52.95 per hour. According to the BLS, there were
          1,847,900 jobs for software developers in 2020External
          link:open_in_new, which includes applications and systems software
          developers. The field is expected to grow 22% between 2020 and 2030,
          which is more than two times faster than the average growth for the
          U.S. job market. Clearly, there’s a need for computer science-related
          technical skills as companies upgrade their business models. A career
          in computer science, especially software development, is an innovative
          space and can be exciting work for those who enjoy lifelong learning.

        <h1>Some misconceptions about CS:</h1>

        <p>
          1. I can put together my own PC, am good with Windows, and can surg
          the net with ease, so I know CS.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Computer Science is the study of how to write computer programs
        </p>

          3. Computer Science is the study of the uses and applications of

        <h1>Some Computer Science Concepts Explained:</h1>

        <h3>1. Binary:</h3>
        <p>
          - Binary is just a system for counting. Like the base 10 used when you
          count on your fingers. But the difference is that it has only 2
          characters : 1 & 0.
        </p>
        <img src="./base-2_binary.png" alt="" class="image_centering" />

        <p>
          Humans have a hard time reading binary, so most often it is repsented
          in a Hexidecimal base-16 format, where 10 numbers
        </p>
        <img src="./hexidecimal.png" alt="" class="image_centering" />

        <p>and 6 letters can represent a 4 bit group called a nibble.</p>

        <img src="./nibble.png" alt="" class="image_centering" />

        <p>
          As a developer, when you write code in a programming language, it will
          eventually be converted into machine code which is a binary format
          that can be decoded and executed by the CPU.
        </p>

        <img src="./machine_code.png" alt="" class="image_centering" />

        <h3>2. Variables: :</h3>
        <p>
          There are Dynamically typed languages, where you dont need to tell the
          program exactly which data type is assigned to the variable, and there
          are Statically Typed languages, where you need to specify the data
          type in your code.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you define a variable, it is stored somewhere in the memory on
          the hardware.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Data Structures:</h3>

        <p>
          When it comes to practical software engineering, one of the most
          fundametnal things we do is organize data in a data structure. <br />
          The most useful data structure is the Array.
